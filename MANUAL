 Obtaining Bowtie Binaries
 -------------------------
 
 Obtain Bowtie binaries for your platform from the Download section of
 the Sourceforge project site.  Binaries are currently available for
 Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.
 
 https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=236897&package_id=288231
 
 Obtaining and Building Bowtie Sources
 -------------------------------------
 
 Building Bowtie requires a GNU-like environment that includes GCC, GNU
 Make and other basics.  It should be possible to build Bowtie on
 a vanilla Linux or Mac installation.  Bowtie can also be built on
 Windows using Cygwin or MinGW (recommended).  If building with MinGW,
 first install MinGW and MSYS (http://www.mingw.org/), the zlib library
 (http://cygwin.com/packages/mingw-zlib/), and the pthreads library
 (http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/).
 
 Bowtie depends on code from Maq v0.6.6 (http://maq.sf.net) and from
 the SeqAn library v1.1 (http://www.seqan.de).  However, all supporting
 code is included in the Bowtie source archive, so there is no need to
 download additional sources.
 
 Obtain Bowtie sources from the Download section of the Sourceforge
 project site:
 
 https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=236897&package_id=288231
 
 Extract the sources, change to the directory where they were
 extracted, and build the Bowtie tools by running GNU make (usually
 with the command 'make', but sometimes with 'gmake') with no
 arguments.  If building with MinGW, run GNU make from the MSYS
 environment.

 Using the 'bowtie' Aligner
 --------------------------
 
 The 'bowtie' aligner takes an index and a set of reads as input and
 outputs a list of alignments.  At most one alignment is output per
 read.  Alignments are selected according to an 'alignment policy' that
 states which alignments are legal.  By default, Bowtie utilizes a
 policy that is equivalent to Maq's quality-aware policy
 (http://maq.sf.net), but it can also be made to enforce an end-to-end
 k-difference policy closer to SOAP's (http://soap.genomics.org.cn/).
 
  Maq-like Policy
  ---------------
 
  The policy has two criteria:
 
  1. Alignments may have no more than 2 mismatches in the first 28
     bases on the high-quality end of the read.

  2. The sum of the quality values at all mismatched positions may not
     exceed 70 (where each position has a quality value on a phred-like
     scale of 0-40).
 
  The numbers stated above are configurable using Bowtie's -n, -e and
  -l options.
 
  If there are many possible alignments that satisfy both criteria,
  Bowtie will give preference to alignments with where the sum from
  criterion 2 is smaller.  Bowtie will not necessarily report the the
  minimal-sum alignment in this case.  
 
  End-to-end k-difference Policy
  ------------------------------
  
  The policy has one criterion: Alignments may have no more than 2
  mismatches.  Quality values are ignored.  The number of mismatches
  permitted is configurable.  Permitting indels is future work.
  
  Command Line
  ------------

  The following is a detailed description of the options used to control
  the 'bowtie' aligner:

 Usage: bowtie [options]* <ebwt_base> <query_in> [<hit_outfile>]

  <ebwt_base>        The basename of the index to be searched.  The
                     basename is the name of any of the four index
                     files up to but not including the first period.
                     bowtie first looks in the current directory for
                     the index files, then looks in the 'index'
                     subdirectory under the directory where the
                     currently-running 'bowtie' executable is located,
                     then looks in the directory specified in the
                     BOWTIE_INDEXES environment variable.

  <query_in>         A comma-separated list of files containing the
                     reads to be aligned, or, if -c is specified, the
                     sequences themselves. E.g., this might be
                     "lane1.fq,lane2.fq,lane3.fq,lane4.fq", or, if -c
                     is specified, this might be "GGTCATCCT,ACGGGTCGT"

  <hit_outfile>      File to write alignments to.  By default,
                     alignments are written to stdout (the console).

 Options:

  -q                 The query input files (specified as <query_in>)
                     are FASTQ files (usually having extension .fq or
                     .fastq).  This is the default.  See also:
                     --solexa-quals.

  -f                 The query input files (specified as <query_in>)
                     are FASTA files (usually having extension .fa,
                     .mfa, .fna or similar).  All quality values are
                     assumed to be 40.

  -c                 The query sequences are given on command line.
                     I.e. <query_in> is a comma-separated list of
                     reads rather than a list of read files.

  -e/--maqerr <int>  The maximum permitted total of quality values at
                     mismatched read positions.  This total is also
                     called the "quality-weighted hamming distance" or
                     "Q-distance."  This is analogous to the -e option
                     for "maq map".  The default is 70.  Note that,
                     like Maq, Bowtie rounds quality values to the
                     nearest 10 and saturates at 30.
  
  -l/--seedlen <int> The "seed length"; i.e., the number of bases on
                     the high-quality end of the read to which the -n
                     ceiling applies.  The default is 28.

  -n/--seedmms <int> The maximum number of mismatches permitted in the
                     seed.  This may be 0, 1 or 2 and the default is 2.

  -v <int>           Forego the Maq-like alignment policy and use a
                     SOAP-like alignment policy.  I.e., report end-to-
                     end alignments with at most <int> mismatches.  If
                     -v is specified, quality values and the -e, -l and
                     -n options are ignored. 
  
  -5/--trim5 <int>   Trim <int> bases from high-quality (left) end of
                     each read before alignment.  Default: 0.

  -3/--trim3 <int>   Trim <int> bases from low-quality (right) end of
                     each read before alignment.  Default: 0.

  -u/--qupto <int>   Only align the first <int> reads from the
                     specified read set.  Default: no limit.
  
  -t/--time          Print the amount of wall-clock time taken by each
                     search phase and index turnover.
  
  --solexa-quals     Convert FASTQ qualities from solexa-scaled to
                     phred-scaled.  Used with -q.  Default: off.
  
  --concise          Print alignments in a concise format; in this
                     mode, each line is a separate.
  
  --maxns <int>      Skip reads with more than <int> N's (no-confidence
                     bases) in their sequence.  Default: no limit.
  
  -o/--offrate <int> Override the offrate of the index with <int>.  If
                     <int> is greater than the offrate used to build
                     the index, then some row markings are discarded
                     when the index is read into memory.  This reduces
                     the memory footprint of the aligner but requires
                     more time to calculate text offsets.  <int> must
                     be greater than the value used to build the index.

  --seed <int>       Use <int> as the seed for pseudo-random number
                     generator.

  --verbose          Print verbose output (for debugging).

  --version          Print version information and quit.

  Output
  ------
 
  The 'bowtie' aligner outputs each alignment on a separate line.  Each
  line is a collection of 8 fields separated by tabs; from left to
  right, the fields are:
  
   1. Read name
   2. Read orientation ('-' or '+')
   3. Index of reference sequence aligned to
   4. Offset into reference sequence of alignment
   5. Read sequence (reverse-complemented if orientation is '-')
   6. Read qualities (reversed if orientation is '-')
   7. Reserved
   8. Comma-separated list of mismatch positions, as offsets from high-
      quality end
 
 Using the 'bowtie-build' Indexer
 --------------------------------
 
 Usage: bowtie-build [options]* <reference_in> <ebwt_outfile_base>
 
    <reference_in>          A comma-separated list of files containing

                            or, if -c is specified, the sequences
                            themselves. E.g., this might be
                            "chr1.fa,chr2.fa,chrX.fa,chrY.fa", or, if
                            -c is specified, this might be
