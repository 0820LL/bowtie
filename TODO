Test data generator:
1) [X] generate random reference 
1) [X] identify unique 22-mers with meryl
-) [X] make reads that map exactly to unique 22-mers at the 5' end AND EITHER:
	1) [X] exact map end to end
	1) [X] have mismatches on the 3' end (exact search with extension)

Code changes and cleanup:		 
2) [ ] Consider bit-packed queries for all search policies, to avoid
		unnecessary conversions in extension-based polcies (after profiling)
2) [ ] Filter low-complexity reads/mers, and/or cap # hits for a search
1) [X] Rename modules and directories (e.g. CSAMapper -> Bowtie)
1) [X] Subversion/CVS import

Output:
2) [ ] Maq-compatible alignment results
1) [ ] Compact edit transcript for inxact matches
2) [ ] Human readable edit transcript for inexact matches

Performance profiling and optimization:
1) [ ] 3' extension (LV)
2) [ ] ebwt_build

Results and data collection:
1) [ ] benchmark suite for table and figure generation
1) [ ] Instrument search policies for collection of mapping stats

UI:
3) [ ] Cocoa interface
1) [ ] CL options review, cleanup
2) [ ] Windows interface

Website:
1) [ ] Basic project page with source and binaries
1) [ ] User manual for ebwt_build and ebwt_search
2) [ ] Cute logo
3) [ ] Wiki

Paper:
	1) [ ] Find reads for benchmarking Maq, SOAP, ELAND, Bowtie
	2) [ ] ...
	
	
Ben's old TODO items:
- Write prefetching / simulated multithreading version of search
- Memory usage statistics
- Optionally handle reverse complement on the text side rather than on
  the pattern side
- Do trimming
  + Trimming is related to flipping; if a difference occurs after some threshold 
- Why do so few of the 1000genomes reads map?
- Hits should be easily mappable back to read ids and reference ids
