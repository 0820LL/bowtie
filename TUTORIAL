Bowtie: an Ultrafast, Lightweight Short Read Aligner

Bowtie Getting Started Guide
============================

 Download and extract the appropriate Bowtie binary release from
 http://bowtie-bio.sf.net into a fresh directory. Change to that
 directory.

 Performing alignments
 ---------------------

 The Bowtie source and binary packages come with a pre-built index of
 the E. coli genome, and a set of 1,000 35-bp reads simulated from that
 genome. To use Bowtie to align those reads, issue this command:

    bowtie e_coli reads/e_coli_1000.fq

 Depending on your computer, the run might take a few seconds up to
 about a minute. You will see bowtie print many lines of output. Each
 line is an alignment for a read. The name of the aligned read appears
 in the leftmost column.

 The first argument to bowtie is the basename of the index for the
 genome to be searched. The second argument is the name of a FASTQ file
 containing the reads.

 Next, issue this command:

    bowtie -t e_coli reads/e_coli_1000.fq e_coli.map

 This run calculates the same alignments as the previous run, but the
 alignments are written to e_coli.map (the final argument) rather than
 to the screen. Also, the -t option instructs Bowtie to print timing
 statistics, which will look something like this (times will obviously
 differ):

    Time loading forward index: 00:00:00
    Seeded quality search Phase 1: 00:00:00
    Time loading mirror index: 00:00:00
    Seeded quality search Phase 2: 00:00:00
    Time loading forward index: 00:00:00
    Seeded quality search Phase 3: 00:00:00
    Time loading mirror index: 00:00:00
    Seeded quality search Phase 4: 00:00:00
    Time searching: 00:00:00
    Overall time: 00:00:00

 Installing a pre-built index
 ----------------------------

 Download the pre-built S. cerevisiae genome package from the Bowtie
 FTP site:
 
    ftp://ftp.cbcb.umd.edu/pub/data/bowtie_indexes/s_cerevisiae.ebwt.zip
    
 All pre-built indexes are packaged as .zip archives, and the S.
 cerevisiae archive is named s_cerevisiae.ebwt.zip. When it has
 finished downloading, extract the archive into the Bowtie 'indexes'
 subdirectory using your preferred unzip tool. The index is now
 installed.

 To test that the index is properly installed, issue this command from
 the Bowtie install directory:

    bowtie -c s_cerevisiae ATTGTAGTTCGAGTAAGTAATGTGGGTTTG

 This command searches the S. cerevisiae index with a single read. The
 -c argument instructs Bowtie to obtain read sequences directory from
 the command line rather than from a file. If the index is installed
 properly, this command should print a single alignment and then exit.

 If you would rather install pre-built indexes somewhere other than the
 'indexes' subdirectory of the Bowtie install directory, simply set the
 BOWTIE_INDEXES environment variable to point to your preferred
 directory and extract indexes there instead.

 Building a new index
 --------------------

 The pre-built E. coli index included with Bowtie is built from the
 sequence for strain 536, known to cause urinary tract infections. We
 will create a new index from the sequence of E. coli strain O157:H7, a
 strain known to cause food poisoning. Download the sequence file by
 right-clicking this link and selecting "Save Link As..." or "Save
 Target As...". The sequence file is named NC_002127.fna. When the
 sequence file is finished downloading, move it to the Bowtie install
 directory and issue this command:

    bowtie-build NC_002127.fna e_coli_O157_H7

 The command should complete quickly without printing anything. When
 the command has completed, note that the current directory contains
 four new files named e_coli_O157_H7.1.ebwt, e_coli_O157_H7.2.ebwt,
 e_coli_O157_H7.rev.1.ebwt, and e_coli_O157_H7.rev.2.ebwt. These files
 constitute the index. Move these files to the indexes subdirectory to
 install it.

 To test that the index is properly installed, issue this command:

    bowtie -c e_coli_O157_H7 GCGTGAGCTATGAGAAAGCGCCACGCTTCC

 If the index is installed properly, this command should print a single
 alignment and then exit.

 Finding variations with Maq
 ---------------------------

 Maq (http://maq.sf.net), by Heng Li at the Wellcome Trust Sanger
 Institute, is a pipeline for identifying mapping reads and finding
 variations with respect to a reference sequence. The output from
 Bowtie can be converted to the same format as is output by Maq's
 short read aligner, allowing Bowtie users to leverage the rest of
 the Maq pipeline to identify variations.
