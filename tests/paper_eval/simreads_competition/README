--------------------

Pits bowtie against maq, maq -n 1, maq (all-in-1-bfq),
maq -n 1 (all-in-1-bfq), soap, and soap -v 1 on about a lane's worth (8
million) simulated 35-bp reads.  Goal is to measure runtimes and memory
overheads on a variety of target sizes, which (hopefully) tells the
story of how bowtie scales much better than maq or soap.

My plan is to run these scripts against whole-human on a large-memory
machine as well as on a workstation with 2 GB of memory.
