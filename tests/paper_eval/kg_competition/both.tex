\caption{Performance measurements for mapping 8.96M 35bp Illumina/Solexa reads
against the whole human genome on a single CPU of a workstation with a 2.4 GHz
Intel Core 2 Q6600 processor and 2 GB of RAM, and on a server with a 2.4 GHz
AMD Opteron 850 processor and 32 GB of RAM. Bowtie speedup is calculated with
respect to wall clock time. Both CPU time and wall clock times are included to
demonstrate that no one tool suffers disproportionately from I/O pauses or
contention with other processes. Note that Maq and Soap create their indexes
while mapping, whereas Bowtie must be provided with a pre-built index of the
genome.  The cost of building the Bowtie index is not included in these timings
since we expect that in practice that cost will be rapidly amortized across
multiple mapping jobs. Reads are taken from the 1000-Genomes project pilot via
the NCBI Short Read archive, accession \#SRR001115 and trimmed to 35bps.
Reference sequences were the contigs of Genbank human genome build 36.3. Soap
was not run on the workstation because its memory footprint would have exceeded
the physical RAM of the workstation. For the Maq runs, the reads were first
divided into chunks of 2M reads each, as per the Maq Manual. Soap v1.10 and Maq
v0.6.6 were used. }
