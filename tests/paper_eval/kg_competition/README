Pits bowtie against maq, maq -n 1, maq (all-in-1-bfq),
maq -n 1 (all-in-1-bfq), soap, and soap -v 1 on a lane of 1000-Genomes
reads (SRR001115).  Goal is to measure fraction of reads mapped for all
tools, and a secondary goal is to measure runtimes, memory overheads on
a non-simulated data set.

My plan is to run these scripts against whole-human on a large-memory
machine.  I do not plan to run against a variety of target sizes, in
contrast to 'simreads_competition,' nor do I plan to run on a
workstation.  The goal is chiefly to report what fraction of the reads
are mapped by these tools so that the reader can be confident that
bowtie is at least competitive in its ability to place reads.  The fact
that we'll also get performance numbers for a non-simulated read set is
a side-benefit.  These performance results could be reported either in
a standalone table or in the same graph/plot with the
'simreads_competition' results.
