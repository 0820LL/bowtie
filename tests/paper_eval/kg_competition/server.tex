\caption{CPU time for mapping 8.96M 35bp Illumina/Solexa reads against the whole human genome on a server with a 2.4 GHz AMD Opteron 850 processor and 32 GB of RAM. Reads were originally extracted as part of the 1000-Genomes project pilot. They were downloaded from the NCBI Short Read archive, accession \#SRR001115. Reference sequences were the contigs of Genbank human genome build 36.3. Soap was not run against the whole-human reference because its memory footprint exceeds physical RAM. For the Maq runs, the reads were first divided into chunks of 2M reads each, as per the Maq Manual.}
