bowtie_reads_mapped
-------------------

Runs bowtie against whole-human against 1000-Genomes reads that have
been trimmed to various lengths (40, 35, 30, and 25 base pairs) and
collects statistics about how many mappings were possible for each 
major bowtie mode (i.e. exact end-to-end, 1-mismatch end-to-end, and
Maq mode).  That information is distilled down to a set of .stats
files, which are parsed and sent to gplot/gnuplot to produce an .eps.
