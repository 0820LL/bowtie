builds
------

Runs double-index ebwt_build on texts of various sizes: human
chromosomes 22 and 2, and the whole human genome.  These texts
correspond to the texts used in 'simreads_competition'.  Results will
be presented in a table, either folded into the simreads_competition
results or in a separate table.
