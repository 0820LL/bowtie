genome_varies
-------------

Runs bowtie against genomes of sizes varying in length from whole-human
down to a 1/16th-length prefix of whole-human, with intermediate points
at each log2.  The size of the read set is held constant.  All reads
are simulated from only the relevant prefix of the human genome.  For
each genome length, bowtie is run in both exact-hits-only mode and
1-mismatch mode.  The goal is to characterize how bowtie's running time
scale with the size of the genome in both modes.
