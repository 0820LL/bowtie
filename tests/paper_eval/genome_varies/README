genome_varies
-------------

Runs bowtie against genomes of sizes varying in length from whole-human
down to a 1/16th-length prefix of whole-human, with intermediate points
at each log2.  The size of the read set is held constant.  All reads
are simulated from only the relevant prefix of the human genome.  For
each genome length, bowtie is run in exact end-to-end mode, 1-mismatch
end-to-end mode, and Maq mode.  The goal is to characterize how
bowtie's running time scales with the size of the genome in all modes.
We expect bowtie to scale largely independently of genome size in exact
end-to-end mode.  We expect steeper scaling factors for the more
complex modes.
