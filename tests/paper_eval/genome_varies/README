genome_varies
-------------

Runs bowtie against genomes of sizes varying in length from whole human
genome, down to a 1/16th-length prefix of the human genome, with
intermediate points at each log2.  In each case the read set used is
the same size and all reads are simulated from only the relevant prefix
of the human genome.  In each case, bowtie is run in both
exact-hits-only mode and 1-mismatch mode.  The goal is to characterize
how bowtie's running time and memory usage scale with the size of the
genome in both modes.
