SNP calling experiment
----------------------

Objective: 
    Demonstrate that Bowtie can call SNPs as well as Maq at least an 
order of magnitude faster than Maq.

Input data: 
    Human reference (NCBI build 36)
    Donors:
        - Human permuted uniformly randomly at 1/800 bp on avg
        - Human via SNP set from dbSNP
    Simulated reads: 25-40bp @ 1-5x coverage of:
        - chrY
        - chr2
        - chr22
        - whole human
        
Output data:
    Bowtie mapping stats:
        - # best mappings for each read (histogram)
        - Total mapped (matching) sequence
        - Strand bias
    Maq cns2snp output
